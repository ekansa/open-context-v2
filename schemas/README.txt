OPEN CONTEXT Version 2 Schemas



Open Context <http://opencontext.org> is an open access data publishing service that primarily serves the archaeological community. Open Context currently uses MySQL as a primary datastore, and Apache-Solr for faceted search indexing.

The files in this directory contain the database schema and Solr faceted search configuration schema. The Solr Schema needs to be placed in the appropriate directory of the Apache Solr application.
